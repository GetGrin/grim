Cross-platform GUI for [GRiN ãƒ„](https://grin.mw) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 
for maximum compatibility with original [Mimblewimble](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin) implementation.
Initially supported platforms are Linux, Mac, Windows, limited Android and possible web support with help of [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) - immediate mode GUI library in pure Rust.

Named by the character [Grim](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Grim) - the shape of a large, black, menacing, spectral giant dog.
